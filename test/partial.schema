# Schema that tests how to take only partial schema into interface.
# The situation may be that a generic server does have huge schema, so
# huge that the embedded device does not have memory nor need for it.
# The device may need to implement only few of the schema items.
# This is how to implement specific subset of huge schema.
#
# In the following schema only the set item is needed from the nice.schema.
# Writing like this will derive everithing from the set.
# The flat tree will contain only items needed for the set
